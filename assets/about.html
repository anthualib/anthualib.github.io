            <li><strong>I am a twin.</strong> My parents got me at a bargain: a buy-one-get-one free deal along with my twin sister. To this day, we argue who was the "free" one.</li>
            <li><strong>My twin and I are best friends</strong>, but are complete opposites. I am the idealist that's moved three times in the past 8 years. She's the pragmatist who still lives in near home and is saving for a house. Our differences comes with a lot of mutual wisdom.</li>
            <li><strong>Everyone in my family are helpers.</strong> My dad is a postal carrier. My mom is a caretaker. My oldest sister is a behavioral therapist. My twin is a music teacher. And I am an (aspiring) librarian.</li>
            <li><strong>I was raised Buddhist.</strong> My home temple is the <a href="https://hsilai.org/">Hsi Lai Temple</a>, and some of my family are practicing monks. While I am not overtly religious, a lot of Buddhist values drive my interests and motivations.</li>
            <li><strong>I am an avid gravel biker</strong> and do some bikepacking in the summers. The longest route I've done is a three-day, 90-mile ride on the California Coast. I also commute by bike, ride so much so that my therapist has said its an issue.</li>
            <li><strong>I am slowly getting into skiing</strong> and have the broken bones to prove it.</li>
            <li><strong>I collect tarot cards</strong> and hope to be eventually good enough to do readings for friends.</li>

            <h4>Redlands, California</h4>
            <p class="center"><em>2016 to 2020</em></p>
            <p>I attended the University of Redlands for my undergrad, where I received a Bachelor of Science in Chemistry. I am grateful to have the opportunity to do a research project on the topics of environmental chemistry and microbiology. This involved spending a semester in the East Sierra Nevadas, collecting glacial samples and studying watersheds.</p>
            <p>The city of Redlands itself is a desert-y suburb <em>right</em> at the very edge of the LA basin. It’s charming downtown introduced me to the notion of supporting local businesses. Being seated at the foot of the San Bernardino mountains meant there was ample hiking and camping close by!</p>
            <div class="onedot"></div>
            <img src="/images/eugene.jpg" id="eugene">
            <h4>Eugene, Oregon</h4>
            <p class="center"><em>2021 to 2024</em></p>
            <p>After college, I visited a friend in Eugene and immediately fell in love with the city. Moving there was a very risky, but rewarding decision. Starting off unemployed, I landed three jobs, all related to my field of interest! I simultaneously worked at a community college resource center, a public library, and a tutoring center. I attribute the hard work I did here to kick-starting my career in higher education and libraries.</p>
            <p>Eugene is notable for the Willamette, a river spanning length of a 13-lane highway, that splits the town in half, and phenomenal bike infrastructure that connects pedestrian life. While developing quickly, the city has remained committed to protecting its strong urban boundaries. Because of this, it is nestled between miles of dense state forest, making it a prime location for outdoor activity of all kinds. The state has the highest amount of missing persons for a reason!</p>

            <h4>Madison, Wiscosnin</h4>
            <p class ="center"><em>2024 to ongoing</em></p>
            <p>I currently live in Madison and work full-time at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Libraries. I am also attending the iSchool, where I am pursuing an MA in Library and Information Studies.</p>
            <p>The city of Madison should win a reward for “most interesting place that the rest of the country doesn’t really know about”. The city is home to the state capitol, a major four-year university, and a charming downtown, all stuffed on a narrow strip of land between two lakes. Also notable are the phenomenal parks, and the extensive bike trail converted from former railway. It’s because of this that the League of American Bicyclists has labeled Madison one of the most bikeable cities in the US.</p>
