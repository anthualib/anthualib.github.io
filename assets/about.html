                <p>Born in Los Angeles, my parents got me and my twin sister at a bargain: a BOGO deal! To this day, my twin and I are best friends, but we couldn't be more different: I am an idealist, and she is the pragmatist. Through our vastly different perspectives and mutual perception, our friendship has made my world bigger. As an adult, I often see things in context of contrast and dicotomy. More specifically, that opposites can represent balance, rather than conflict.</p>

        <p>I also come from a family of practicing Buddhists. While religion was not a huge part of my upbringing in a traditional sense, much of my childhood was imbued with the concepts compassion, unconditional goodwill, and the acceptance of others. I think it's fitting how this has reflected in all our chosen professions: my older sister works as a child therapist, my twin sister is a teacher, and I am an (aspiring) librarian.</p>

                <p>As a kid, I grew up biking circles around my grandma’s backyard in Rosemead. I watched movies like <em>The Goonies</em>, and was always jealous of these kids having bike adventures in the woods, with no parental supervision. I dreamed of a childhood like that, but it was impossible in car-centric sprawl of LA suburbia. I have relocated a lot since, and every move has been inspired by this love of bikeable infrastructure and proximity to nature.</p>

            <h4>Redlands, California</h4>
            <p class="center"><em>2016 to 2020</em></p>
            <p>I attended the University of Redlands for my undergrad, where I received a Bachelor of Science in Chemistry. I am grateful to have the opportunity to do a research project on the topics of environmental chemistry and microbiology. This involved spending a semester in the East Sierra Nevadas, collecting glacial samples and studying watersheds.</p>
            <p>The city of Redlands itself is a desert-y suburb <em>right</em> at the very edge of the LA basin. It’s charming downtown introduced me to the notion of supporting local businesses. Being seated at the foot of the San Bernardino mountains meant there was ample hiking and camping close by!</p>

            <img src="/images/eugene.jpg" id="eugene">
            <h4>Eugene, Oregon</h4>
            <p class="center"><em>2021 to 2024</em></p>
            <p>After college, I visited a friend in Eugene and immediately fell in love with the city. Moving there was a very abrupt, very risky decision. Started off unemployed, I three jobs, all related to my field of interest! I simultaneously worked at a community college resource center, a public library, and a tutoring center. I attribute the hard work I did here to kick-starting my career in higher education and libraries.</p>
            <p>Eugene is notable for the Willamette, a river spanning length of a 13-lane highway, that splits the town in half, and phenomenal bike infrastructure that connects pedestrian life. While developing quickly, the city has remained committed to protecting its strong urban boundaries. Because of this, it is nestled between miles of dense state forest, making it a prime location for outdoor activity of all kinds. The state has the highest amount of missing persons for a reason!</p>

            <h4>Madison, Wiscosnin</h4>
            <p class ="center"><em>2024 to ongoing</em></p>
            <p>I live in Madison and work full-time at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Libraries. I am also attending the iSchool, where I am pursuing an MA in Library and Information Studies. You can read more about what I am doing here on my <a href="currentroles.html" data-type="page" data-id="156">Current Roles page</a>.</p>
            <p>The city of Madison should win a reward for “most interesting place that the rest of the country doesn’t really know about”. The city is home to the state capitol, a major four-year university, and a charming downtown, all stuffed on a narrow strip of land between two lakes. Also notable are the phenomenal parks, and the extensive bike trail converted from former railway. It’s because of this that the League of American Bicyclists has labeled Madison one of the most bikeable cities in the US.</p>
