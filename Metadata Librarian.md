Originally I hadCandidates
- 9
- 42
- 67
- 80
- 84
- 85
All ended up scoring the highest for me
* Then I realize that 67 and 85 were the same candidate
* SO I was going through my runners up this morning
	* And end up finding better candidates 5 and 8
	* I realize I definately was grading harder in the beginning



I thought all candidates were solid because:
- metadata experience in digital collections
- explicitly talked about metadata standards (not MODS, METs PRIMIS)

Going through my notes here
### I liked Candidate 84
- Their cover letter to me felt the most authentic
- I was impressed with both the variety of the places they worked, in depth with their accomplishments
	-  dropping names of different organization and grants 
	- demonstrated a lot of proven experience
- I dont know software in this field, but googling Oxygen XML and OpenRefine, I'm guessing these are complex data management tools
### Candidate 80
- Cover letter was also super solid
	- had very hands on experience
- explicitly named both MOD and PREMIS 
	- in a context that convinced me he know what he was talking about
- Helps that they have direct experience at the university and if hopefully familiar with our environment
- Very good supervising


### 42
Definately have a nonconventional career, (Minnesota Lottery, and Braille Library), so I'm wondering how applicable his skills will be at the univeristy
- But I like that they were very explicit with their technical skills
	- linux command lines
	- python, SQL, powershelld, C progrmaing

### 67
- Good hands on experience with a lot of standards
- breifly mentioned the phrase "command-line" in their objective statement, but nothing in their material demonstrated anything specific examles
-

### 9
I ranked really high, because I thought they had a very solidly written cover letter, but my only concern is that a lot of their experience are not very recent.
- Their two main examples in their cover letter is from 2022 and 2017 in their resume


### Runner ups
- 5: has supervising and leadership experience in archivist, but I nedd up knocking off points because I didnt notice they name drop any standards
- 8: Over 10 years of leading some pretty cool digital preservation projects. They hit all of the bullet points
	- command-line tools
	- python scripting
	- they mentioned automation
	- really good supervising


My assessment is that all their cover letterss
