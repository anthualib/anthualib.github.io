Since 2022, I've been stuck in a loop of listening to the same three artist's entire discographies. The endless choice offered by streaming services have always overwhelmed me, and I wanted to slow down and be more intentional with my music. Getting a classic iPod has helped me form an identity around artists that I love-- after all, digital copies belong to ME, and can never be taken away by war-supporting corporations. Itâ€™s also made discovering new albums feel more meaningful, encouraging deeper listening rather than passive consumption.

This page will be updated throughout the year, as I come across albums that resonate with me enough to write about. I'll try to keep each "review" short.

### Imaginal Disk by Magdalena Bay...
[![Imaginal Disk](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4b/Magdalena_Bay_-_Imaginal_Disk.png)

...is an album that feels particularly alien. My best description of it is "what hot girl summer would sound like on a distant planet". I've always been wary of how technology and social media has affected our mental health. Photoshopped bikini bodies already do absolute destruction our body images. This album is a sort of thought experiment of how technologies of the distant future-- the hypothetical world of simulated realities, genetic modification, memory manipulation-- would amplify these insecurities. 

I'm a sucker for solid three-track runs. The progression of *Vampire in the Corner* into *Watching T.V.* into *Tunnel Vision* is particularly transcendent bop, that surprisingly ends in an psychedelic-esque jam.
