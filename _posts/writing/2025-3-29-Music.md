Since 2022, I've been stuck in a loop of listening to the same three artist's entire discographies. The endless choice offered by streaming services have always overwhelmed me, and I wanted to slow down and be more intentional with my music. Getting a classic iPod has helped me form an identity around artists that I love-- after all, digital copies belong to ME, and can never be taken away by war-supporting corporations. It’s also made discovering new albums feel more meaningful, encouraging deeper listening rather than passive consumption.

This page will be updated throughout the year, as I come across albums that resonate with me enough to write about. I'll try to keep each "review" short.

### "Imaginal Disk" by Magdalena Bay...

...is an album that feels particularly alien, but hopelessly familiar. My best description of it is "what hot girl summer would sound like on a distant planet". I've always been wary of how technology and social media has affected our mental health: photoshopped bikini bodies and instagram beauty filters have done absolute destruction to our body images. MagBay explores how technologies of the distant future-- the hypothetical world of simulated realities, genetic modification, memory manipulation-- would amplify these insecurities. The album's opener, *She Looked Like Me!* captures the feeling of a contemporary teenage's crushing inadequacy upon discovering her celebrity look-alike. However, it could simultaneously be warning about a future where literal genetic doppelgängers could be algorithmically designed to embody true and idealized beauty, making self-acceptance not just emotionally, but also biologically dubious. Its ultimately an album about platonic ideals, a disconnect between an idealized essence and realized experience, and technology's empty promise to close that gap.

I'm also a sucker for solid three-track runs. The progression of *Vampire in the Corner* into *Watching T.V.* into *Tunnel Vision* is eerie, hypnotic, existential, but playfully transcendent, with a surprisingly psychedelic jam at the end. If you're in a hurry, I'd highly recommend these three songs as a starter.

### "Patterns in Repeat" by Laura Marling...

..is a mother's love distilled into an album, written by a woman nearing the autumn of her life. It is a tapestry of maternal experience, exploring the transformations that comes with womanhood, while acknowledging one's place in the eternal patterns of life. The unconditional love of a newborn child, the tolls of an aging body, fleeting memories of past lovers, and the shedding of past identities during transition to new stages in life.

Steeped through it all is the generational cycle of motherhood, where an emotional inheritance is passed from generations of women before her, towards the life she had created ahead of her. In a way, Marling reflects how mothers pass on not just a genetic traits, but also the profound opportunity to live a messy but beautifully complex life. In context, Marling had written most of these songs while pregnant with her second daughter. In singing extensively about her sacrifices, she seems to end with a message:  "I want you to know I gave it up willing. Nothing real was lost in the bringing of you to me. I want you to have a piece of my maternal flame".

Through the cycles of giving and receiving, growth and decline, sacrificing and gaining, nothing essentially is truly lost, but instead transformed and passed forward in an eternal pattern.
