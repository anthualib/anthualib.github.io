## Overview
This is meant to be a very beginner-friendly guide for those who aren't necessary tech savvy (like myself). It covers the ins-and-outs of how to get a static site and a blog published onto the world wide web, but will not function as a complete guide on web development (HTML/CSS/Javascript). Consider taking a class or self-teach in order to fill in that gap. 

The resulting site will include two things:
- A static site of interlinked .html files
- A blog written in markdown that is pieced together and organized by Jekyll

I would consider this the cheapest and barest bones method to make a content-driven website. 

### A tidbit about Wordpress
If you are starting out with no web development knowledge, a Wordpress site is probably the most sane pathway to getting a website running. You will have to pay a few monthly fees for the ever-convenient content management system (CMS), but you will be stuck with a site that can look a little same-y to other WP sites. Customization happens via plugins, which can get expensive, bloated, or more prone for security vulnerabilities. 

If getting a site published ASAP is your biggest priority, it is probably best to just go with the Wordpress Free Plan (if you don't mind having a subdomain) or Wordpress Personal Plan (if you want a custom domain). However, if you are fairly peculiar with how your site looks, enjoy web developing, or are very limited on funds, consider building your own site from the ground up and follow this guide to get it running!

## Tools I use

| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Visual Studio Code | VSC is probably the most popular code editor. It includes many creature comforts like syntax highlighting, plugin support, and live previewing. It also integrates directly with Github. When editing in HTML, CSS, and Javasctipt for your website's fundamental content, this is the app to use.                                                                                            |
| Github             | In simplest terms, Github is a platform for developers to store, share, and manage code. A Github repository is where I keep the raw files of my website. There are some useful web development services packaged with Github, which I cover below.                                                                                                                                           |
| Github Pages       | Github Pages is a hosting service that Github provides that allows users to create static sites directly from a repository. Github Pages is a great service because it does not require a backend server or database to function (building this infrastructure can be very time and money intensive). It also deploys somewhat instantaneously, which means your site will update immediately |
| Jekyll             | Jekyll is baked into GH Pages, and serves as a static site generator (the part of GH Pages that turns raw text into web pages). Jekyll can either spit out HTML verbatium, or can be used piece together layouts, markdown files, and snippets.<br>                                                                                                                                           |
| Obsidian           | Obsidian is my markdown editor of choice (its moreso a note-taking application that happens to use markdown in its editor). What makes Obsidian great is that it dynamically renders markdown so that you so that you aren't just looking at lines of code. You can also inject your website's stylesheet so that you can immediately see what that final product looks like!                 |

### Optional: Purchase a custom domain
My custom domain, "AnthonyHua.com" was purchased at ~$10 a year from a domain registrar. It does not matter which once, but I went with [PorkBun](https://porkbun.com/)

**What to call it?** If this for a professional website, the standard is to buy your name: "(firstname)(lastname).com". If it is not available, you can use some variation of it, like adding a middle initial or adding your profession at the end (like "anthonyhualibrarian.com"). If privacy is your concern and you want to stay anonymous, use a fun alias! For instance, I'm currently sitting on my pen name "peanutbuddha.com", for a future project.

**Domain Extensions:** .com web domains are by far the most common, trusted, and most visible (look into SEO), however most names under this domain are likely taken. You can also consider trending domains like .io, .co, or .ai. but they can be exceedingly expensive
### Set up your Github repository
I chose Github because they offer a free hosting platform via Github Pages, and free custom domain mapping. Start by [creating an account](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/creating-an-account-on-github), and following these instructions:
1. Click 

For the blog portion (both for my writing and recipes), I use Jekyll, which is prepackaged with Github Pages. Jekyll is a static site generator

### Jekyll
Jekyll functions completely invisibly, meaning there is no fancy GUI to configure anything. There are two necessary points of interaction with Jekyll:
- **the "config.yml" file:** the brain of Jekyll containing all the options in a text format
- **the "\_posts" and "\_layouts" folders:** where the content of your blog goes

Jekyll also introduces .md (markdown files). Markdown is a very lightweight plain-text formatting (as oppose to rich text formatting used in MS Word). It strikes a balance of being fairly intuitive for humans to use, while still being compatible with software to parse. In the context of Jekyll's workflow, blog posts (or any page really) are written in Markdown, then are pieced together with layouts that add consistent metadata and styles to every post.

#### How to set up a Jekyll blog
You can simply create the aforementioned folders and config.yml onto the root of your repository. The tricky part is configurating your config.yml file correctly. Jekyll's documation provides a [default set](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/default/)

#### How to display lists of posts
There are [a list of arrays you can learn](https://cloudcannon.com/cheat-sheets/jekyll/)
## File Structure


Blogs have many repeating elements; to add a post, you have to have the same metadata
Creating multiple pages content can be very time-consuming, so these aspects of Jekyll can make a blog very easy to set up.

As a note: GH Pages will automatically handle the Jekyll build on their servers. You do **not** have to install Jekyll or Ruby, unless you want to develop and test your site locally. (what this looks like in laymans term... Visual Studio Code wont preview the blog portion of your site... you'll need to deploy on Github first in order to see changes)



Another thing is that Obsidian interfaces directly into your computers filesystem (rather than a cloud). Pointing your Github Repository, code editor, and markdown editor makes updating your site seemless!
