## Overview
This is meant to be a very beginner-friendly guide for those who aren't necessary tech savvy (like myself). It covers the ins-and-outs of how to get a website published onto the world wide web, but will not function as a complete guide on web development (HTML/CSS/Javascript).

I would consider this the cheapest and barest bones method to make a website with functional attributes. You will need to know how to write or already have a site fully written in HTML, CSS, or javascript. You can likely 

### A tidbit about Wordpress
If you are starting out with no web development knowledge, a Wordpress site is probably the most sane pathway to getting a website running. For the benefit of convenience, you will have to pay a few monthly fees.

If you don't mind having a bit of a cookie cutter site, its probably best to just go with the Wordpress Free Plan (if you don't mind having a subdomain) or Wordpress Personal Plan (if you want a custom domain). However, if you are fairly peculiar with how your site looks, enjoy web developing, or are very limited on funds, consider building your own site.

| Github             | In simplest terms, Github is a platform for developers to store, share, and manage code. A Github repository is where I keep the raw files of my website. There are some useful web development services packaged with Github, which I cover below.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Github Pages       | Github Pages is a hosting service that Github provides that allows users to create static sites directly from a repository. Github Pages is a great service because it does not require a backend server or database to function (building this infrastructure can be very time and money intensive). It also deploys somewhat instantaneously, which means your site will update immediately                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Jekyll             | Jekyll is baked into GH Pages, and serves as a static site generator (the part of GH Pages that turns raw text into web pages).

| Obsidian           | Markdown is a very lightweight plain-text formatting (as oppose to rich text formatting used in MS Word). It strikes a balance of being fairly intuitive for humans to use, while still being compatible with software to parse. In the context of Jekyll's workflow, blog posts can be written in Markdown, then pieced together with common layouts that add consistent metadata and styles to every post.<br><br>Obsidian is my markdown editor of choice (its moreso a note-taking application that happens to use markdown in its editor).

I chose Github because they offer a free hosting platform via Github Pages, with custom domain support (my custom domain "AnthonyHua.com" was purchased at ~$10 a year from a domain registrar. It does matter which once, but I went with [PorkBun](https://porkbun.com/))

For the blog portion (both for my writing and recipes), I use Jekyll, which is prepackaged with Github Pages. Jekyll is a static
